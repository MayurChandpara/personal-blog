            <p>WeTheParents.org is one of my favorite parent blogs. Rather than getting Mom’s view or Dad’s opinion, you get both sides of the parenting story. The content is a real mixture, Neve, the Mom tends to write about empowering mom stuff whilst her husband, Keane, seems to be a big kid who spends his time playing with and reviewing kids toys.</p>

            <p>The main goal of this blog is to make parents’ lives easier by doing the research for them. It can be a pain trawling through Google and to find the best products, so this mom and dad team get geeky finding out which products are the best for the whole family. (And which gear is just a waste of money!)</p>

            <h3>Food Blog</h3>

            <p>My favourite food blog is this one. I think the style, design and tone of voice is just top notch. Lindsay really has blogging down to a fine art, not just with the writing but also in knowing how to make money from blogging. I reckon she has a massive email list which she has built up over the years, that she can use to literally print money with. Targeting her email list with her latest blog posts, affiliate links, deals, offers, coupons will make her plenty of cash each month.</p>

            <p>I love her blogger resources page as well. A clever way to inspire other bloggers to take the plunge and use what she uses to create a successful food blog.</p>

            <h3>Cookie & Kate</h3>

            <p>A very slick and beautifully designed food blog. Much like Pinch of Yum, Cookie + Kate knows how to create compelling food content that effectively engages with their audience.</p>
